* How does the idea comes up?

Sometimes I think what if the source code can be translated into human natural language in
some way. Or display annotation beside of source code. It would help newbie (like me) to
understand the program source code better and faster.

* Emacs ElDoc

Emacs ElDoc already display docstring for symbol in minibuffer. There are some packages
can change its display place like "eldoc-overlay". Can be displayed in context with popup,
property-text or overlay etc.

* My idea details


* Examples

** Lisp dialects

#+begin_src clojure :eval no
;; +--> define a function named hello-world.
;; |   +--> function name.
;; |   |          +--> arguments.
(defn hello-world []
  ;; +--> print string "Hello, World!".
  (prn "Hello, World!"))
#+end_src

** Python/Ruby/JavaScript

** C/C++/Java

** HTML

** CSS

* Try to implement in Emacs as an extension

Here is an new created empty repository https://github.com/stardiviner/eldoc-annotation.el
that I will add code in future.
